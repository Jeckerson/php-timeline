The design goals were to improve performance of complex applications, and improve the modularity of PHP's code base. Such applications were made possible by PHP 3.0's new features and support for a wide variety of third party databases and APIs, but PHP 3.0 was not designed to handle such complex applications efficiently. <br> The new engine, dubbed 'Zend Engine' (comprised of their first names, Zeev and Andi), met these design goals successfully, and was first introduced in mid 1999. PHP 4.0, based on this engine, and coupled with a wide range of additional new features, was officially released in May 2000, almost two years after its predecessor. In addition to the highly improved performance of this version, PHP 4.0 included other key features such as support for many more web servers, HTTP sessions, output buffering, more secure ways of handling user input and several new language constructs.",

Active development of PHP/FI 2.0, which had all-but ceased as of November of the previous year, was now officially ended. After roughly nine months of open public testing, when the announcement of the official release of PHP 3.0 came, it was already installed on over 70,000 domains around the world, and was no longer limited to POSIX-compliant operating systems. A relatively small share of the domains reporting PHP as installed were hosted on servers running Windows 95, 98, and NT, and Macintosh.
