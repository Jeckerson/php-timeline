The design goals were to improve&#10;    performance of complex applications, and improve the&#10;    modularity of PHP's code base. Such applications were made&#10;    possible by PHP 3.0's new features and support for a wide&#10;    variety of third party databases and APIs, but PHP 3.0 was&#10;    not designed to handle such complex applications efficiently.&#10;   &#10;   <p class=\"para\">&#10;    The new engine, dubbed 'Zend Engine' (comprised of their&#10;    first names, Zeev and Andi), met these design goals&#10;    successfully, and was first introduced in mid 1999. PHP 4.0,&#10;    based on this engine, and coupled with a wide range of&#10;    additional new features, was officially released in May&#10;    2000, almost two years after its predecessor.  In addition&#10;    to the highly improved performance of this version, PHP 4.0&#10;    included other key features such as support for many more&#10;    web servers, HTTP sessions, output buffering, more secure&#10;    ways of handling user input and several new language constructs.",

A relatively&#10; small share of the domains reporting PHP as installed were hosted on &#10;servers running Windows 95, 98, and NT, and Macintosh.
